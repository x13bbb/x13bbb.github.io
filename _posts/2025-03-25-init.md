One thing that I think is admirable about my pal Liam is how he puts his ideas out into the world, and constantly experiments with them, refining them. The universe seems to react to his output.

The way that he experiments with novel ideas is deeply connected to writing. I was asking him about his process and views. 

Q: When I write, I'm plagued by how I imagine the universe might respond to me. How do you know that people will respond positively--if at all?

A: He stated that he never writes for other people. And, elaborated that he's guided by the principle of 'creating what you think should exist'. 

On a practical level, he believes that there are few people who think deeply and write about any given topic. Because, the barrier is: you need to both be able to produce these ideas, and have enough space in your life to do so. And, people are usually preoccupied. Therefore, you can create value by thinking deeply about problems and developments and outputting 'what should exist' in the world.

I think this is just a joyous approach to writing and I'd like to keep these principles with me moving forward.
